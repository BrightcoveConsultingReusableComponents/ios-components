# Classes

## KSAdvancedPicker

Many people complain about `UIPickerView` being hardly customizable. `KSAdvancedPicker` tries to overcome its limitations in a straightforward manner as the class is highly based on well-known iOS components (like `UITableView`).

## KSBasicMapAnnotation

The most basic `MKAnnotation` implementation.

## KSCheckView

A simple checkbox control.

## KSEditEnder

A tiny control for an extremely common task: hide keyboard when touching outside edited field.

## KSProgressDownloader

HTTP fetcher with embedded caching showing an `UIAlertView` with download progress.

Depends on [ASIHTTPRequest](http://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request).

## KSSheetView

Graph paper background with custom content through Core Graphics context delegation.

# Categories

## MKMapView+Zoom

Zoom on multiple map annotations optionally including user location. A delta can be specified to adjust the zoomed area.

## NSMutableArray+Shuffling

Convenient shuffling methods for `NSMutableArray`.

## NSString+DateConversion

Convert date format in `NSString` without bothering with `NSDateFormatter`.

## NSString+Digest

Generate MD5 and SHA1 digest from `NSString`.

## UIAcceleration+DeviceAngle

Compute the device 2D angle. Looking at the device laying flat from the home button: the x is the rotation around the longer display axis (towards left), the y is the rotation around the shorter one (towards the observer). This category is sort of an exercise (probably useless), so there's much room for improvement.

## UIBarButtonItem+CustomImage

Add a custom image or background image to your `UIBarButtonItem`.
